# MMD-Roblox-Utility

"Ro-MDD" tools; a little collection of script utilities used to help import MMD animations to roblox.

The import process is hands-on and involves a lot of blender, but some scripts were made to assist in the process. Here is the code. I love rigs, rigging, and working with skinned meshes. Honestly, it's satisfying!

(EXAMPLE) ReplicatedFirst.Anim_Script is a script that plays animations, it is an example inlclude in this code. It's a little messy script I made for the single, sole purpose of running animations. That's what it does. Nothing more complicated.
