# Ro-MMD Tools

"Ro-MMD" tools; a little collection of script utilities used to help import MMD animations to roblox.

The import process is hands-on and involves a lot of blender, but some scripts were made to assist in the process. Here is the code. I love rigs, rigging, and working with skinned meshes. Honestly, it's satisfying!

"(EXAMPLE) ReplicatedFirst.Anim_Script" is a script that plays animations, it is an example included in this code. It's a little messy script I made for the single, sole purpose of running animations. That's what it does. Nothing more complicated.


Possibly, in the far, fantastic future, I will make a full-on UI-based plugin called "Ro-MMD Tools" if I get the time to give back to this amazing community. Here, for now there's these scripts I've used...I understand most people won't find use of it on roblox.com, a children's platform... So I submit this code mainly for portfolio reasons, until I can find a better way to incorporate such tools in an official platform plugin over there.

Additionally, blender MMD tools (https://github.com/UuuNyaa/blender_mmd_tools) is a big helper in the process of getting ready and converting MMD models in blender for Roblox. I take no code from there, I haven't dug into it, honestly. I take spiritual inspiration for the name, only, for a similar service I am trying to offer here, to Roblox.
